## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Gulp
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about using <picture> element in html, to improve the responsiveness of the website, depending on the images optimized for various layouts.

I also learned and practices grid and inline-flexbox for elements, using GULP for parsing SASS (SCSS) files into CSS files, and ow to reset the factory settings of browsers.

### Continued development

I would add more designs for various breakpoints, like widescreens and tablet screens. Also would add some animations when loading the page.
